        This website is itself one of my little projects!
        Made with <a href="https://github.com/manuellamas/manuellamas.github.io">simple HTML and CSS</a>.

    <p>I've been amazed by awesome data visualizations before, and so I thought I should try it out to see what I could do. This was my first time creating one.</p>
    <p>Here's an animated plot of Portugal's COVID-19 daily new cases. If you run the script from <a href="https://github.com/manuellamas/Portugal-COVID19-Plot">this repository</a>, it'll fetch the most recent data from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/">Our World in Data</a> and create the animation.</p>
    <p>Below is the result (with data of 12/03/2022)</p>

    <h4>Model visualization - Forest-fire Model</h4>
    <p>
        While reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39088592-the-model-thinker">The Model Thinker</a> I encountared a few models that I wanted to try animating.
        So here's one.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest-fire_model">Forest-fire Model</a> at each period a cell is chosen.
        If it's empty there's a probability <i>p</i> that the space will be filled with a tree, and if there's already a tree there there's a probability <i>1-p</i> it'll burn.
        If it burns then in the next period all trees in neighbour cells also burn.
    </p>
    <p>
        The example below is for 3000 periods and <i>p = 0.95</i>.
        Here's the <a href="https://github.com/manuellamas/Forest-Fire-Model">code</a> in case you want to try different sizes of the "field" and different probabilities.</p>
