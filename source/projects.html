    <h4 id="animated_plot_portugal_covid19">Animated plot - Portugal COVID-19 Daily New Cases</h4>
    <p>I've been amazed by awesome data visualizations before, and so I thought I should try it out to see what I could do. This was my first time creating one.</p>
    <p>Here's an animated plot of Portugal's COVID-19 daily new cases. If you run the script from <a href="https://github.com/manuellamas/Portugal-COVID19-Plot">this repository</a>, it'll fetch the most recent data from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/">Our World in Data</a> and create the animation.</p>
    <p>Below is the result (with data of 12/03/2022)</p>
