I"–<p>Itâ€™s easy to just accept the status quo and work with it.<br />
But what if you had a better way of doing things? An idea that could change things for the better, no matter how little the scale.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s easier and comfortable to just leave things proceed as theyâ€™ve <em>always</em> have, but itâ€™s a lot more rewarding to improve it.<br />
The problem is that just because you have (or think you have) a more acceptable solution, it doesnâ€™t mean that it will be accepted.<br />
I say problem but only since thatâ€™s whatâ€™s on your mind when you think about doing it. Because now youâ€™re putting something at stake, and your idea can be rejected.</p>

<p>But what of it?<br />
Youâ€™re not your idea. Even if it doesnâ€™t work (or isnâ€™t accepted) it doesnâ€™t mean that <em>you</em> are being rejected, it simply means that your idea is.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re in a good enough environment youâ€™ll get feedback on why it doesnâ€™t work and you might even be able to improve it so that it does get accepted later on.<br />
But regardless, thereâ€™s no reason not to try it.</p>

<p>We can all wait for someone else to start it, which may never happen, orâ€¦ we can be the ones that start something.<br />
Going ahead even if itâ€™s not clear what could happen, thatâ€™s taking initiative.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s your choice, but if thereâ€™s something you want to change, then staying still wonâ€™t do you any good.</p>
