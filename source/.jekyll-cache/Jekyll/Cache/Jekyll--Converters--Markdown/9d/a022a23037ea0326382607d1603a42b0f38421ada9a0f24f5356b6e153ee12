I"¾<p>Hello, itâ€™s beenâ€¦ much longer than what I expected.</p>

<p>My initial goal was to write one of these every Sunday, but as you can see, nearly a month as passed already.</p>

<p>Why did this happen?
Well, because somewhere along the way I lost track of why I wanted to do this.
I felt as if I had to do it, while all of this just started because it was something I wanted to do.
What happened was that I got lost, I mixed up the goal with the metric (which was doing it every Sunday).</p>

<p>I thought too hard.
Instead of forgetting about everything else and just spending time thinking and writing, I spent time thinking about how I had to do it.
I made a big deal out of it and so it became a daunting task.
A mix of wanting to do it but not wanting to do it badly.</p>

<p>The solution was simple.
I should see this as when I started itâ€”as an experiment.
It doesnâ€™t matter if it comes out poorly or not.
What matters is that I keep showing up, and that I learn from practice.</p>

<p>Overthinking leads us nowhere.
Itâ€™s by tossing aside those pestering thoughts that we can grow.
Instead of trying to do it perfectly, we show up and practice regardless of what the outcome <em>might</em> be.</p>
