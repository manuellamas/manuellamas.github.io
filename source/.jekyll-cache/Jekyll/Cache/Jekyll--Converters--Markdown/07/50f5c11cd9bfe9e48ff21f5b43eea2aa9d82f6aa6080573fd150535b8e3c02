I"N<p>Hey there!</p>

<p>I’m glad that you’re here.
This is the beginning of my attempt to try and learn in public.
I’ll write my thoughts hoping to learn something from the process.</p>

<p>The end of the year is getting close, so this seems like a good time to try something new.</p>

<p>Let me just make it clear that these are just my thoughts.
What I write might be wrong or you may simply disagree with me.
In case I am in fact wrong or you don’t agree with me on something, feel free to let me know by sending an email to <a href="mailto:manuelbravolamas@gmail.com">manuelbravolamas@gmail.com</a>.
In fact, please do, as this is precisely what I’m looking forward to.
Learning in public so that others can chime in whenever they want.</p>

<p>For now there will be no specific set of topics or categories about what I’ll write, it’ll just be about whatever is on my mind at the moment.
Though it may change in the future.</p>

<p>This is the first post so I’ll keep it short, it’s really just to let you (which should be just the void at this point) know what I intend to do.</p>
