I"Œ<p>Planning an unfeasible list of tasks to achieve on a certain day will most likely end up being counterproductive.<br />
Itâ€™s not by planning a ton of tasks that youâ€™ll get to do them all.<br />
Not only that, but since even if it would never happen, you expected it to do so, youâ€™ll feel as if youâ€™ve somehow failed.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s why managing your expectations is so important.<br />
Planning alone doesnâ€™t get things done. You need planning sure but donâ€™t overplan.</p>

<p>How would you rather feel at the end of a day? Feeling bad about facing a failure, or motivated since youâ€™ve managed to go through what you wanted to do?<br />
Which one affects how you work in a positive way?</p>

<p>I think itâ€™s safe to say that by making it achievable, youâ€™re motivated as opposed to pressured (and stressed) to work.<br />
Planning something isntâ€™ the same as doing it, with that in mind create the environment, and mood, that makes it easier to commit to your work.</p>

<p>As always these are just my own thoughts.<br />
But Iâ€™ve learned that at least to me, managing my own expectations is crucial to being able to motivate myself.</p>
