title: "Can you act on it?"

Don't let doubt consume you.
If you're troubled by something start by asking yourself: "Can I act on it or not?"

In case you can change it don't linger.
Act on it right away if possible, else plan your course of actionâ€”but *decide* now.

If what troubles you is outside of what you can do, then accept it, and choose to move forward.

Don't waste life allowing your mind to loop around a troubling thought without purpose.
Be clear on what you can do, don't avoid acting if it's what you've decided, and learn to accept when you must.
