There's only so much time you have.
Even if there's plenty you want to do, time is limited.
Struggle as much as you want to but the day won't stretch past 24 hours.
We often think: "I want to do X but I just don't have the time."

But is it a matter of not having enough time, or simply of not knowing what we really want?
To do what you want to do, you need to prioritize.
You need to know your priorities, and to act with them in mind.

There are some things that you must do, but there are many that you do not.
What can you prune to give room to do what you truly want to do?

Know what your priorities are.
Remove the things that aren't them.

That's easier said than done of course, because what you need to remove, is likely not something you *don't* want to do.
If you don't have to do it and you don't want to do it, then you're likely not doing it already.
The problem lies with what you enjoy doing, but know, after reflecting about it, that it isn't a priority.

Take care of your time, and you'll be able to do much more of what you truly want to do.

Reflect on how you spend your time throughout a normal day.
That is most likely the best thing you can do to actually start a change.

Start by asking yourself two simple questions:
- What are the things I most want to do?
- What are the things I take the least value from?
