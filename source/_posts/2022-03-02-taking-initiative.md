It's easy to just accept the status quo and work with it.
But what if you had a better way of doing things?
An idea that could change things for the better, no matter how little the scale.

It's easier and comfortable to just leave things proceed as they've *always* have, but it's a lot more rewarding to improve it.

The problem is that just because you have (or think you have) a more acceptable solution, it doesn't mean that it will be accepted.
I say problem but only since that's what's on your mind when you think about doing it.
Because now you're putting something at stake, and your idea can be rejected.

But what of it?
You're not your idea.
Even if it doesn't work (or isn't accepted) it doesn't mean that *you* are being rejected, it simply means that your idea is.

If you're in a good enough environment you'll get feedback on why it doesn't work and you might even be able to improve it so that it does get accepted later on.
But regardless, there's no reason not to try it.

We can all wait for someone else to start it, which may never happen, or...
we can be the ones that start something.
Going ahead even if it's not clear what could happen, that's taking initiative.

It's your choice, but if there's something you want to change, then staying still won't do you any good.
