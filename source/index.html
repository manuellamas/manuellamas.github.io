        Hi, welcome to my page!
        Thanks for stopping by.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to know more about me you can check my <a href="/about">"about" page</a> or see what I'm doing <a href="/now">now</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Occasionally I write a small post with <a href="/thoughts">my thoughts</a>.
        It's still a very green (and sporadic) experiment but feel free to check it if you're curious.

        If you resonate with something said here, completely disagree with it, or even if you are simply curious, I'd love to hear what you have to say.
        Doesn't need to be anything fancy, just <a href="mailto:manuelbravolamas@gmail.com">say "Hi!"</a>.
