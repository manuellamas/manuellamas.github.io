    <p>Hi, welcome to my page! Thanks for stopping by.</p>
    <p>If you want to know more about me you can check my <a href="/about">"about" page</a> or see what I'm doing <a href="/now">now</a>.</p>
    <p>I intend to share <a href="/thoughts">my thoughts</a> on whatever comes to mind from time to time. That's still yet to start. Let's see how that goes...</p>
    <p>Keep in mind this is a <a href="https://github.com/manuellamas/manuellamas.github.io" target="_blank">work in progress</a>, so as expected for now it might feel a bit empty, and some things out of place.</p>
