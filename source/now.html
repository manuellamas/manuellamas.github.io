    <h1 class="main-title">What I'm doing now</h1>
    <p>
        I'm in Porto, Portugal.
        Here's what I've been doing:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Working as a Tech Consultant at <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/company/kpmg-portugal/>KPMG</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reading.
            Right now it's mostly the <em>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em> trilogy of five.
            Here's the updated list of the books I'm <a href="https://goodreads.com/manuellamas" target="_blank">reading now</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Writing about ideas that I get from reading (or not) to reflect deeper about them.
            Sometimes sharing them <a href="/thoughts">in public</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Learning Japanese at <a href="https://sigarra.up.pt/flup/en/WEB_PAGE.INICIAL">FLUP</a>.
            I'm only at the beginning, but it's been even more fun than what I expected!
        </li>
        <!-- <li>
            Learning how to do the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(juggling)" target="_blank">3 Ball Shower</a> on both directions. So that I can later try to learn the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_(juggling)#Reverse_cascade" target="_blank">reverse cascade</a>.
        </li> -->
    </ul>
    <!-- <p>I'll update this page whenever something changes.</p> -->
