    <h1 class="main-title">What I'm doing now</h1>
    <p>I'm in Porto, Portugal, studying Computer Science at <a href="https://sigarra.up.pt/fcup/en/web_page.inicial" target="_blank">FCUP</a> while at the same time figuring out what I want to do. Here's what I've been doing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>My main focus right now is my master thesis. I'm still not sure what exactly will be my goal but my topic revolves around how to study and compare music (tracks) resorting to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science" target="_blank">Network Science</a>. For now I'm mostly experimenting and reading what already exists out there. Since before I started I had zero music knowledge, I often have to read a bit on some musical concepts and it's becoming more and more interesting to learn about it.</li>
        <li>I've started reading not too long ago and my focus has been on self-improvement books and anything that makes me think really. On the side I've also started reading fiction. Here's what I'm <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126005490-manuel-lamas" target="_blank">reading now</a></li>
        <li>Learning how to do the juggle move <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower_(juggling)" target="_blank">The Shower</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'll update this page whenever I advance or finish any of these goals, or begin something new.</p>
