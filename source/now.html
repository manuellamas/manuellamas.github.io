    <h1 class="main-title">What I'm doing now</h1>
    <p>I'm in Porto, Portugal, studying Computer Science at <a href="https://sigarra.up.pt/fcup/en/web_page.inicial" target="_blank">FCUP</a> while at the same time figuring out what I want to do. Here's what I've been doing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>My main focus right now is my master thesis. I'm still not sure what exactly will be my goal but my topic revolves around how to study and compare music (tracks) resorting to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science" target="_blank">Network Science</a>. For now I'm mostly experimenting and reading what already exists out there. Since before I started I had zero music knowledge, I often have to read a bit on some musical concepts and it's becoming more and more interesting to learn about it.</li>
        <li>I'm trying to read books on topics that I know little to nothing about, a small (but exciting) way to "extend my horizons". On the side I'm reading The Stormlight Archive. Here's what I'm <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126005490-manuel-lamas" target="_blank">reading now</a></li>
        <li>Learning how to do the juggle move <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(juggling)" target="_blank">The Fountain</a> (currently just trying to do a 2-ball throw with a single hand)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'll update this page whenever something changes.</p>
