    <h1 class="main-title">What I'm doing now</h1>
    <p>
        I'm in Porto, Portugal, trying to figure out what I want to do.
        Here's what I've been doing:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Actively looking for an exciting and challenging work position. Let's see what happens...
        </li>
        <li>
            Reading, <em>a lot</em>.
            Both fiction and non-fiction, to gather ideas and learn from facts or stories.
            The next non-fiction books I read will likely be on history since that's what I've been finding the most interesting recently.
            Parallel to that, in fiction, I've started reading the Throne of Glass novels.
            Here's the updated list of the books I'm <a href="https://goodreads.com/manuellamas" target="_blank">reading now</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Writing about the ideas that I get from reading (in private) to think.
            Sometimes sharing some of those <a href="/thoughts">in public</a>.
        </li>
        <!-- <li>
            Learning how to do the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(juggling)" target="_blank">3 Ball Shower</a> on both directions. So that I can later try to learn the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_(juggling)#Reverse_cascade" target="_blank">reverse cascade</a>.
        </li> -->
    </ul>
    <p>I'll update this page whenever something changes.</p>
