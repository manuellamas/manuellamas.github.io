    <h1 class="main-title">What I'm doing now</h1>
    <p>
        I'm in Porto, Portugal.
        Here's what I've been doing:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Starting a new journey as a Tech Consultant at <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/company/kpmg-portugal/>KPMG</a>.
            Excited to learn a lot from it!
        </li>
        <li>
            Reading.
            Since I've begun my professional journey I've been mostly only reading fiction.
            I hope to restart my non-fiction reading soon-<em>ish</em>.
            Right now it's mostly the Throne of Glass novels.
            Here's the updated list of the books I'm <a href="https://goodreads.com/manuellamas" target="_blank">reading now</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Writing about ideas that I get from reading (or not) to reflect deeper about them.
            Sometimes sharing them <a href="/thoughts">in public</a>.
        </li>
        <!-- <li>
            Learning how to do the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(juggling)" target="_blank">3 Ball Shower</a> on both directions. So that I can later try to learn the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_(juggling)#Reverse_cascade" target="_blank">reverse cascade</a>.
        </li> -->
    </ul>
    <p>I'll update this page whenever something changes.</p>
