    <h1 class="main-title">What I'm doing now</h1>
    <p>
        I'm in Porto, Portugal.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Working as a Junior Software Engineer at <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/company/kpmg-portugal/>KPMG</a>.
            So many pieces to get to know how they understand.
            A nice learning opportunity.
        </li>
        <!-- <li>
            Reading.
            <\!-- For the curious ones who are here, I'm getting back to reading non-fiction books. Right now with SPQR :) --\>
            Here's the updated list of the books I'm <a href="https://goodreads.com/manuellamas" target="_blank">reading now</a>.
        </li> -->
        <!-- <li>
            Writing about ideas that I get from reading (or not) to reflect deeper about them.
            Sometimes sharing them <a href="/thoughts">in public</a>.
        </li> -->
        <li>
            Learning Japanese at <a href="https://sigarra.up.pt/flup/en/WEB_PAGE.INICIAL">FLUP</a>.
            It has been super fun to deliberately and consistently (through classes) learn something new.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reflecting on what to focus.
            What to remove.
        </li>
        <li>
            Appreciating creators more and more.
            As something I would like to pursue in some shape or form.
            Having fun talking to some artists at some occasional local events.
        </li>
    </ul>
