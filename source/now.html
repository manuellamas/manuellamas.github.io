    <p>
        I'm in Porto, Portugal, studying Computer Science at <a href="https://sigarra.up.pt/fcup/en/web_page.inicial" target="_blank">FCUP</a> while at the same time figuring out what I want to do.
        Here's what I've been doing:

    <ul>
        <li>
            Looking for an exciting and challenging work position. Let's see what happens...

            I've recently started reading a bit on Stoicism, and Philosophy in general.
            Classics from ancient Greece and Rome.
            I find reading something that was written so long ago to be a pretty interesting experience.
            Parallel to that I'm reading Mistborn.
            Here's what I'm <a href="https://goodreads.com/manuellamas" target="_blank">reading now</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Learning how to do the juggle move <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(juggling)" target="_blank">The Fountain</a> (currently just trying to do a 2-ball throw with a single hand)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'll update this page whenever something changes.</p>
